##      Introduction to LangChain

Interactions with LLMs, prompts design, integration of external data, utilization of tools to expand LLM capabilities allowing them to perform more complex tasks.
Building composable workflows using runnables, enabling to create modular LLM applications.

### Summary

The rise of large language models is changing how we process data and develop software. LangChain provides the essential tools to bridge the gap, making it easy to incorporate LLMs into our applications. 
This project offers a practical, hands-on introduction to LangChain, the core concepts and techniques for developing intelligent, LLM-driven applications by building a system that answers questions about planets.
